    <h2>Deadline 1: Learning Unity</h2>

    <h3>Expanding on Shaders</h3>
    <p>Shaders can be used in a lot of different ways that haven't been introduced in class. This video showcases a masking shader and explains some of its uses.</p>

    <h3>Expanding on Collisions</h3>
    <p>In class we created a spawner that spawns cubes with random velocities. This video expands upon that premise and adds extra functionality.</p>

    <h3>Expanding on GUI</h3>
    <p>I created a cannon that is controlled with a GUI to showcase a practical use of in-world gui</p>

    <h3>Expanding on Triggers</h3>
    <p>This video shows how triggers can make something happen when a player walks into a room by using a light that turns on while the player is inside</p>

    <h2>Deadline 2: Reinventing the Wheel</h2>

    <h3>Continuous Movement & Turning</h3>
    <p>I recreated continuous movement, continuous turning, and snap turning. I added the functionality to move or turn on a different pivot than just the head -- with moving, you can change it so pressing forward follows the forward direction of your head, one of your hands, or your hip. With turning, it will change the point your character rotates around to your head, one of your hands, or your hip. I also added a button that can be held to run as well as a function to snap turning to turn all the way around.</p>
    
    <h3>New Rig, Player Collider, Gravity, Jumping</h3>
    <p>I added a player collider to my rig that allows gravity to affect the rig without your head being inside the floor as the velutils rig does. This also allows for jumping as a player control. I also have spots for the hip and feet for full-body, though I haven't gotten around to adding functionality to them yet.</p>
    
    <h3>Teleportation</h3>
    <p>I recreated teleportation from scratch and made it so the teleport line's material changes color to indicate when the player can or can not teleport somewhere.</p>
    
    <h3>Projection</h3>
    <p>I developed my own movement option that is sortof an in between of Continuous Movement and Teleportation. It was inspired by VRChat's Holoport Locomotion as well as Convrge VR's Ghosting. I call it Projection movement because the type of movement is similar to the concept of Astral Projection.</p>
